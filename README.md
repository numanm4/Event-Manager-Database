This project utilizes backend and frontend code to make a event manager database. when you run the insertEvent.js file and type https://localhost:1000/form into the 
URL tab you will be taken into the frontend part of the code which will allow you to enter event data and when you hit submit, that data will be sent to your local
database and it will store there. using the other html files  you can delete, search, and update the event you made. addtionally there is also an email sending page that will allow you to send emails to multiple recipients to remind them or let them know about an upcoming event they are invited to.
